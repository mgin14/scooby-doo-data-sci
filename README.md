# scooby-doo-data-sci

This is my final project for ISTA 320 Data Visualization. I chose to do my project on Scooby-Doo franchise, where I got the dataset from a July 2021 TidyTuesday Challenge found [on GitHub from jthomasmock](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-13/readme.md), which he got from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/williamschooleman/scoobydoo-complete). I used the unupdated version so data is from July 2021 and not October 2021.

Research Questions:
1. Who has caught the culprit the most per series? How has the frequency of this character catching the culprit change over the year as new series are created?
2. Which motive was common throughout the franchise?
3. What were the top most engaged episodes in the franchise up as of July 2021?
